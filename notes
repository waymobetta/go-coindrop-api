-----------------------------
- send me messages
- give me donations
- this is my public space for admiration, solicitation, etc.
- coindrop is just a type of messaging board
- venmo for online avatars
- do not disturb
- selective tasks only
- determine worthiness by reputation
- showcase open to give feedback?


* one of the major problems from online systems is that people sometimes give in hopes of receiving but there is a bystander effect where you can still gain value without giving back any.


* coindrop must be a platform where individuals can showcase their individual contributions to projects, and have these contributions serve as badges to the world. The initial reachout from projects can be based on results from the online reputation platforms, but have this reptuation translate into the real world via project-based contribution stamps.
- money can NOT be the determining factor for earning one of these stamps, rather it must be earned and given out by the project

* coindrop is a recognition platform that simply allows people to be found, and then serves as a board for their earnings.
